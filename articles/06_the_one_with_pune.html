        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Why did I went to Pune? I wanted to visit Pune for the first time. Everything started when I registered on workindia app (App khar sangu t kontyach kamach nahi). Applied on various java related jobs there as I hold grip over it. But koni bhaav nahi dela. Then a whatsapp msg tolds me that their "company" is offering ₹17K per month at Katraj, Pune.</p>
            
            <p>I thought why not. Why not give it a shot. After all, I need to start from somewhere right. Why not join this company. But the trick which I missed was that, the dude didn't tell me the company's name, address. Just Katraj. But I wanted to go to Pune. So didn't cared for it.</p>
            
            <p>So, the company's name was <b>"Asort"</b>. And it was a so called co-commerce company as they called. As my father got into <b>"Qnet"</b> back in 2019, I knew what this asort company was into. I knew what direct selling, network marketing, pyramid scheme etc mean.</p>
            
            <p>From 20th to 23rd of March, the "training" went on. Roommates were cool but always kept an eye on me. Didn't ask me to do any chores. Kinda surprising. As I lived with roommates in Nagpur before. And they were kinda hostile. Not much friendly. But here, they were cleaning the room, making dinner, washing dishes. But did not asked me to do any work. The room was 1BHK. Had probably 6-7 boys residing in it. No room had a fan. Told me after some days they'll get the fan too.</p>
            
            <p>3 days went into the so called training. Asort company office was in a building where infront was a medical store and daily needs stores. And you had to got to the office from backside. Which felt a bit odd.</p>
            
            <p>On the 1st day itself, got to see my master's program classmate pranita was there too, this dude beside me who called me to pune ask to not make contact with anybody (I was like wtf; I know her).</p>
            
            <p>In the 3 days "training", all the speakers had an emotional story to tell. Some said they came here from jungles of Odisha and got big, some said they came here from IT background and got big.</p>
            
            <p>Then came the 3rd day, the day of "selection" where an "interview" was to be taken by them. And after selection you had to put into ₹7200 to start your "business". Before this dude came over I got my mobile and search google for asort. A reddit link opened. And voila!. This company too was a pyramid scheme masking as a commerce company. Decided to call this company off and leave for Amravati asap that day.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                <b>Going to Amravati:</b> Quickly booked a train ticket on my way to room. Got in room, packed all my clothes, towels, things etc quick af. It was 12pm noon. Then went to Katraj chowk by auto. Had lunch there of ₹80. And then took a bus to Pune railway station. When I got there ticket got cancelled (It was on waiting list). It was 2:30pm. Then I had sugarcane juice there. I am king of doing timepass actually. Was there till 3pm. Then booked vijayant travels from pune to amt for ₹900 at 5:45pm. Picked a rapido taxi and went to sangamwadi. Took half an hour to search for vijayant travels. Got the location. Charged my mobile there. spend 2 or so hours till bus came. After that got into bus. Bus was good for a ₹900 ride, it had ac, bedsheets seemed good, space to sleep; overall it was nice. Had a PICT dude beside me to travel. He was going to Nagpur. Reached Amravati next morning at 5:45am.
